Installing Octopi is a pretty straightforward task. 

Assuming you have updated Qt4 libs installed in your system, just run:

	makepkg -f

Wait for the compilation and then install the generated package (as 
root), using:

	pacman -U [--force] <nameOfTheGeneratedOctopiPackage.tar.xz>

You can also install the generated package notifier, using:

	pacman -U [--force] <nameOfTheGeneratedOctopiNotifierPackage.tar.xz>

Octopi is located at the system utilities menu of your Desktop 
Environment.


Enjoy!
